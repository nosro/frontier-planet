# Frontier Planet Game

## Description
A human colony has been started on an alien world. Â It is a harsh and dangerous place, but with your leadership the settlement could grow and even flourish. You will need to carefully manage the competing settlement priorities, and choose which technologies to build in order to overcome this planet's unique conditions. You must also be prepared for any crisis which could arise through accidents, shortages, disease, or psychosis, and other events.

Even with the constant struggle for survival, politics emerge. Other players can become your allies or rivals, shifting loyalties as each of you decides to cooperate or compete for control. Only one leader will win the game if the colony makes it through this difficult period. The grim alternative is that bickering and mismanagement dooms everyone.

Frontier Planet uses worker placement and action cards to represent colony management in an abstract and simple way. It has an extensive tech tree game board which is built up during play.

Every game starts with a set of random Planetary Hazards, which along with a random timeline of Incidents, poses thousands of different game scenarios.

The game can be set up in a few different ways to allow for degrees of cooperative or competitive styles of play, handling up to 4 players, as well as solitaire. Game time is roughly 1 - 2 hours.
